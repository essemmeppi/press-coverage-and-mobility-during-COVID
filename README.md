# Press coverage and mobility during COVID-19
Does press coverage of COVID-19 have an impact on individuals’ mobility choices during the pandemic?

At the time of writing, December 2021, COVID-19 is still catching the attention of policymakers, media actors, and the public. Taking into account this setting, I study whether there is evidence of an effect of daily newspapers on individuals’ movement choices. To do so, I analyse the COVID-19 coverage of two daily Italian outlets whose consumption is strongly geographically concentrated, Il Resto del Carlino and La Stampa. To assess the impact of the newspapers’ pandemic coverage on people, I combine data on their quantitative coverage of COVID-19 from Factiva with data on individual mobility at the aggregate level provided by Facebook Research. This research aims at understanding whether a short-term effect exists. Hence, I consider the evolution of COVID-19 coverage and mobility on 27 days for Emilia-Romagna and 19 days for Piemonte, a time frame chosen to exclude the effect of changes in policy. Combining these variables — and taking into account also COVID-19 cases and weather — I analyse the short-term relationship between the printed press and mobility, investigating their dynamic evolution over time and their correlations.
